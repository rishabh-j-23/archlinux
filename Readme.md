# dev Script

A simple bash utility to manage **reload**, **config**, and **install** actions for your development environment.

---

## Features

- Reload custom scripts for various packages.
- Manage package configuration by copying from repo to `$HOME/.config`.
- Install packages via custom install scripts.
- Supports **dry-run** mode to preview actions without executing.

---

## Usage

```bash
./dev <action> <package> [--dry-run]
````

### Actions

| Action  | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| reload  | Run a reload script located in `./reload/<package>.sh`       |
| configs | Copy configs from `./configs/<package>/` to `$HOME/.config/` |
| install | Run an install script located in `./packages/<package>.sh`   |

## Examples

Reload the `hypr` package:

```bash
./dev reload hypr
```

Copy config files for `kitty` package:

```bash
./dev configs kitty
```

Install the `neofetch` package:

```bash
./dev install neofetch
```

Dry-run example (no changes made, just preview commands):

```bash
./dev configs hypr --dry-run
```

---

## How it works

* The script looks for scripts or config folders inside the repository relative to where itâ€™s run.
* `reload` and `install` execute respective shell scripts.
* `configs` deletes existing config directory and copies fresh config files.
* The optional `--dry-run` flag prints commands instead of executing them.
